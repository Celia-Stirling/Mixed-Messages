# Christmas Mixed Messages

This project is my attempt at the **Codecademy Mixed Messages Project**.

It will tell you what sort of present you deserve for Christmas, based on randomly selected present, size, description and delivery method.

The **project objectives** were:
1. Build a message generator program using JavaScript.
2. Use Git version control.
3. Use Command line.
4. Develop locally on your computer.
